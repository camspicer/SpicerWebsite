                        I took three "gap" years before coming to school and had a lot of time to learn new things! One of my favorite things I learned in that time was to play the guitar. I am self-taught and really enjoy thoery, performance, and just straight jamming with my buddies! I hope to continue to improve while I'm in college.

                        I own a black, Martin Custom X Series thats perfect for fingerstyle and folk. My favorite band would have to be Penny and Sparrow,

                         My favorite guitar-based band would have to be Penny and Sparrow. This <a href="http://www.thedigitalcontinent.space/beginners-guide-to-our-favorite-band/">blogpost</a> describes my feelings about them well...
